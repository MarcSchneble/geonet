choice of delta and h (95% rule) --> done
fix bug in runifgn -->

dist2V variable --> nochmal checken

chi^2 statistics for edf smooth terms
make algorithm faster
include ggmaps in plotting
montgomery network ohne s(hour) fitten
interaction of linear covariates
compute integral of intensity fit
add two intensity functions
simulate from intensity (use linearity)
scale the dist2V variable
also fit kernel models with geonet (i.e. wrapper around spatstat functions but with geonet plotting)
implement density = TRUE in intensity_lpp
rename network coefficients by edge and vertice
plot functions (i.e. intensity by line width)

\title{Design Matrix for Linear B-Splines on a Geometric Network}
\usage{
bspline_design(G, knots, bins)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{An object of class \code{gn}.}

\item{knots}{A list which contains the knots on which the
B-splines are defined}

\item{bins}{list of which contains the mid points of the bins.}
}
\value{
A sparse matrix design matrix of dimension N x J.
}
\description{
\code{bspline_design} constructs the design matrix which represents
the (log-)baseline intensity on the geometric network.
